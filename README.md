Updated/modified version of PlatformIO sample/demo project by [antoinec4](https://github.com/antoinec4/waveshare_7in_LVLG_platformIO).

---

**Note**:

To get the sample working I also needed to manually run `pip install intelhex` and re-install PIO package `tool-esptoolpy`.
This may not be required/related, potentially just specific to my environment.
